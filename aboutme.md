I started my PhD at the school of applied science and engineering  at the [University of Virginia] in 2019. Previously I completed my MSc at the University of Memphis, Electrical and Computer Engineering in 2018, as a graduate fellow. I did my Master in mHealth and machine learning, the topic of my Master thesis was "Retrospective Analysis for Severity Classification of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Asthma with Heart Rate and SpO2". The thesis can be found [here](https://digitalcommons.memphis.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2942&context=etd). In my time as research assistant at summer I mostly worked on machine learning applications in the field of healthcare.
